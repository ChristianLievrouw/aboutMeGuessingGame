      <h2>A little about me</h2>
      <p>I was born in Mason City, IA and raised in Charles City, IA. After graduating Charles City High School in 2011 I attended NIACC. During my first year of college I could not find an interest in anything so I decided to take a break from school and go find a job. For the next three years I did different jobs here and there mainly in factories. I was not happy with factory work so I gave college another try. I attended Hawkeye Community College in Waterloo, there I found an interest in computer science. A year later my first child was on his way so I once again took a break from college and got a job. In 2018 I figured out about DeltaV and was very interested in pursuing that opportunity. For the next two years I stayed in contact with Aaron Horn and got all of my things in order to where I was able to quit working and dedicate my time to the program. My goals for the end of DeltaV are to learn the skills i need to succeed in the coding job world and to land a career instead of just another job. My dream career would be a software developer for Apple.</p>
